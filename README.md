Model Implementation

ðŸ“Œ Logistic Regression for Loan Prediction

We apply Logistic Regression to determine the probability of loan approval based on:

Applicantâ€™s income, credit score, employment type, loan amount, and other financial indicators.

The model outputs a probability score, classifying applications as approved (1) or rejected (0).

ðŸ“Š Model Performance Evaluation

Accuracy: Measures overall correctness.

Precision & Recall: Balances false positives and false negatives.

ROC-AUC Score: Evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between approved and rejected loans.
